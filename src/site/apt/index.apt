Properties Maven Plugin

  The Properties Maven Plugin is here to make life a little easier when dealing
  with properties.  It provides goals to read and write properties from and to files,
  and also to set system properties.
  
  It's main use-case is loading properties from files instead of declaring them in
  <pom.xml>, something that comes in handy when dealing with different environments.
  
  If you have a properties file called <teams.properties> with this content:
  
----------------------------------------
  toronto=raptors
  miami=heat
----------------------------------------
  
  and invoke the {{{read-project-properties-mojo.html}properties:read-project-properties}}
  goal, it would be the same as declaring the following in your <pom.xml>:
  
----------------------------------------
  <properties>
    <toronto>raptors</toronto>
    <miami>heat</miami>
  </properties>
----------------------------------------
  
  The properties loaded from files can be used to filter resources
  differently for different environments.  Those using Spring's 
  {{{http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyResourceConfigurer.html}PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer}}
  can see how these goals can be useful.
